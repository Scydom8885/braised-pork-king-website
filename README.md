FOOD hawker Alex Gan had previously sold local fare such as Claypot Chicken Rice, Pan Mee and stir-fried dishes.

But when he wanted to open his stall at Big Family Restaurant hawker centre in SS15, Subang Jaya in Selangor, he found that those dishes were already being sold by other vendors.

“The owner of the hawker centre suggested that I sell Taiwanese Braised Pork Rice.

“So I came up with my own version of braised pork rice recipes.”



Gan is a cook who has worked in several restaurants and cafes.

“Most of my family members are cooks.

“My father was a chef and he taught me how to cook from the time I was a child,” he said.

At Big Family Restaurant, Gan offers two dishes – Braised Pork Rice and Stewed Pork Rice with vegetables as a side dish.

He starts each day cutting up the pork belly, stir-frying it before marinating it for about two hours.

The standard bowl features rice topped with braised pork or stewed pork, eggs, tofu and a side dish of vegetables like cabbage or pickles.

The braised pork topping is bathed in a flavourful gravy, which ties everything together and creates a harmonious blend of tastes and textures.

“The gravy is made with eight spices, which are the secret ingredients to my dish,” said Gan.

With the ratio of tender meat to fat, the pork melts in the mouth, though the texture of the meat is discernible with every bite.

The difference between the braised and stewed pork is that the meat for one is sliced into small pieces while the latter has bigger-sized morsels.

“There are customers who like the bigger pieces, so I decided to put that on the menu,” said Gan.

He also makes his own chilli sauce, which adds a little kick to the dishes.
